# Minimalistic Language Learning Project

This is a simple NodeJS + ExpressJS project created for public use.

Working on adding MongoDB as Mongoose to the project. There is no database implemented at the moment.

Used EJS instead of the casual HTML files to make the code shorter and more readable.

USAGE

1. Get to your directory through the console

2. Do ```npm init```

3. Required packages:

```npm i express body-parser jquery jsdom dotenv ejs ```

   You can also install these packages:
  
```npm i mongodb mongoose node-sass ```

4. Go to the server folder in the console and type ```nodemon app.js ``` for the local server to start running.

5. Play with the project and feel free to improve it:)

Work in progress.
