# Minimalistic Language Learning Project

This is a simple NodeJS + ExpressJS project created for public use.

Working on adding MongoDB as Mongoose to the project. There is no database implemented at the moment.

Used EJS instead of the casual HTML files to make the code shorter and more readable.


Work in progress.
